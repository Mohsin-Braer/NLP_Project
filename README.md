## Overview: ##
The exponential growth of social media has brought with it an increasing propagation of hate speech. The ease of communication nowadays has led to an immense increase of exchange of ideas between people, but what was supposed to be a positive dynamic led to one of the biggest dualities of the moment: how to navigate between freedom of speech and the threatening use of insulting and offensive language? To bring the matter into closer context, we often observe YouTube/Twitch administrators frequently facing themselves with the task of manually banning users from their channels.

Countries are currently engaging in initiatives aiming to develop effective counter-measures against this practice and one of the first challenges involved in this combat is identifying hate speech via automatic processes that enable effective decision-making from authorities. Thus, in this project, we aim to build the most effective hate speech detection model that classifies a dataset of tweets into hate or non-hate comments.
